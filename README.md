## 2. File Structures in This Repository

- *Analysis/*
	- `AsianFoodAccess_R.Rmd` contains the full R code used for statistical and spatial analysis in this study.

- *Data/*
	- `FullDataset_Final.xlsx` is the excel file with all the CT-level variables that were imported to R for analysis. 

	- `FullDatasetNew.xlsx` is the excel file that contains both the original variables and the OLS residuals generated by R. It was imported to ArcGIS to test the spatial autocorrelation of the OLS residuals.

	- `SpatialDataset` folder contains the full package of shapefile generated by importing `FullDatasetNew.xlsx` to ArcGIS. In the folder, `SpatialDataset.shp` was imported to R to calculate Spatial Lag Regression. 

	- `FullDatasetSpatial.xlsx` is the excel file generated by R that contains both the original variables, the OLS residuals, and the SLR residuals, which was imported into ArcGIS to test the spatial autocorrelation of the SLR residuals.
