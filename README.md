## Overview of Analysis Workflow


## File Structures in This Repository
- _AsianFoodAccess_R.Rmd_ contains the full R code used for statistical and spatial analysis in this study.

- _FullDataset_Final.xlsx_ is the excel file with all the CT-level variables that were imported to R for analysis. 

- _FullDatasetNew.xlsx_ is the excel file that contains both the original variables and the OLS residuals generated by running the OLS regression models in R. It was imported to ArcGIS to test the spatial autocorrelation of the OLS residuals.

- _SpatialDataset.shp_ is the shapefile generated by importing _FullDatasetNew.xlsx_ to ArcGIS. It was imported to R to calculate Spatial Lag Regression. 

- _FullDatasetSpatial.xlsx_ is the excel file generated by R that contains both the original variables, the OLS residuals, and the SLR residuals, which was imported into ArcGIS to see the spatial autocorrelation of the SLR residuals.
