## Overview of Analysis Workflow


## File Structures in This Repository
- `AsianFoodAccess_R.Rmd` contains the full R code used for statistical and spatial analysis in this study.

- `FullDataset_Final.xlsx` is the excel file with all the CT-level variables that were imported to R for analysis. 

- `FullDatasetNew.xlsx` is the excel file that contains both the original variables and the OLS residuals generated by R. It was imported to ArcGIS to test the spatial autocorrelation of the OLS residuals.

- `SpatialDataset.shp` is the shapefile generated by importing `FullDatasetNew.xlsx` to ArcGIS. It was imported to R to calculate Spatial Lag Regression. 

- `FullDatasetSpatial.xlsx` is the excel file generated by R that contains both the original variables, the OLS residuals, and the SLR residuals, which was imported into ArcGIS to see the spatial autocorrelation of the SLR residuals.
